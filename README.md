Poisson's Croissants NYU DSC x CBRE Datathon Submission

Analyzed risk and relocation metrics to identify vulnerable populations in high-risk flooding areas. Used KNN to create a model that relocated vulnerable populations to a new environment, holistically examined to maintain similar profiles.

The Data Preprocessing code goes through over 15 different csv files as we selected relevant data from FEMA and national census data. We also performed feature creation to modify the dataset and better understand the populations we were analyzing. From there we were able to create a risk classification to perform binary value assignments based on a census tract's risk status.

The combined resulting dataset was implemented by a KNN model to identify the best possible area for relocation.
